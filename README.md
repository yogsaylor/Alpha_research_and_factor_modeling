# Alpha_research_and_factor_modeling

Built a statistical risk model using Principal Component Analysis. Used this model to build a portfolio along with 5 alpha factors and created these factors, then evaluated them using factor-weighted returns, quantile analysis, sharpe ratio, and turnover analysis. Optimized the portfolio using the risk model and factors using multiple optimization formulations. Used the end_of_day dataset from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.
